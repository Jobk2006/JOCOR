#Create two sets:
#set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#set_b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
#Perform the following operations:
#Find the union of the two sets and print it.
#Find the intersection of the two sets and print it.
#Find the difference between set_a and set_b and print it.
#Find the symmetric difference between the two sets and print it.
